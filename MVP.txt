Never Miss a Swing

Pitch/Idea: 

Create a web app that allows users to view 
when and where their favorite sports teams are playing. 
Also allows them to see how much tickets are for those games, 
As well as their current standings.

MVP:
Users can log in using unique credentials
Users can select a sport from a dropdown
users can select a team from a sport
Users can add up to 5 teams to their favorite teams list
favorite teams stats are displayed on home screen
Users can delete teams from the list
When favorite team is clicked, the next game date and time will appear as well as stats
Users can update/change password
Users can add/delete profile picture

MVP Description:

Login Page

A user will type in the website name using the unique url (like nevermissaswing.com)
when they are directed to the website, they will see the login screen. The user will
need to create an account. After their account is created, they can log in. Behind the 
log in fields, there will be a rotating basketball that fades into a baseball, which 
fades into a football and cycles through those. 

Main Page 

I want the main page of the app to be very clean and concise. The only things i want on the
main page is a nav bar and a carosel of the teamballs.

Teamballs

I definitely want the favorited teams to be held in containers in the shape of the ball 
that sport uses. When you click on one of the teamballs, the information will change to
other information about that team. It will carosel through like 5 bits of informations.
I want the teamballs to be 3-D. I want there to be some visual feedback if the team is 
currently playing.

Teamballs information

The information that I want the teamballs to hold is definitely subject to change. I want 
the first bit of info that the teamballs hold to be the teams nickname. Second, if they are 
currently playing, then the current score of the game. Fourth, their record. Fifth, their next 
game.

Additional Features Description:

Second Page

A sixth piece of data that would go on the teamballs would be called "more info" with a button. If the user 
clicks on the button, they will be redirected to a secondary page with more info about that team. The secondary 
page will have a play by play section, it will have stats about current players for that team, and team stats from
years prior.

Additional sports

Instead of just having information from the NBA, users can choose from different sports like baseball, football, 
and hockey.
